Hello everyone!
Welcome to the 11th year of Hillel’s premier social deduction game! Mafia will commence on March 28th, and conclude on April 2nd. I hope you’re all ready for a week of deception, chaos, and fun. It is our pleasure to announce that sign ups for Mafia 2020 are now open! https://forms.gle/airBNzNYtsTDi4U46 
I have a few announcements
We are honored to announce your two new Moderators, Ariella Cohn and Jeremy Schreiber! They join Eleanna Weissman, Batya Teitz, and myself in working to ensure that everyone has the best possible Mafia week! 
The rules are attached below. There have been a few rules changes, including the addition and removal of some Roles. Please make sure to read the rules to ensure you understand the changes that have been made. Also, read the rules to ensure you understand how to play the game. Seriously.
Mafia for Dummies will be released sometime this week. It will be a more entertaining and easily digestible version of the Official Rules. It is still recommended that you read the comprehensive rules, but Mafia for Dummies should contain all you need to play the game.
We’ve added a short quiz to the sign up form on voting procedure. Read the rules. Then sign up. In that order. You can wait until Mafia for Dummies is released if you think that will make it easier. If you need further assistance with the quiz, feel free to ask a Moderator for help.

Rules: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbrBAduBVUPCu37apTyTObvWsl8NC4VG/view?usp=sharing 

We look forward to your sign up!
Sincerely,
The Mafia Moderators

They're holding a meeting tomorrow and there's a task force looking to find students to testify that SGA shouldn't accept the bill because the debate would cause a tremendous toll on the mental (and physical) health of many students during an already difficult time. Would be super helpful -- 2 min's on a zoom call and you'd be given talking points.
